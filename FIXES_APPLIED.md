# Fixes Applied - Expo SDK 53 & ESPN API

## Summary
I've improved the fetch proxy and ESPN data service to be more robust and handle errors better. However, there are manual steps required for the Expo SDK update.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Fetch Proxy (`app/api/fetch+api.ts`)
âœ… **Improvements:**
- Added 2-minute response caching to reduce redundant ESPN API calls
- Increased timeout from 8s to 15s for slow ESPN responses
- Better error messages with response previews
- Improved User-Agent and headers for better ESPN compatibility
- Cache both successful and failed responses to prevent retry storms
- Better JSON parsing with detailed error reporting

### 2. Updated ESPN Base URLs (`utils/realDataService.ts`)
âœ… **Improvements:**
- Updated ESPN_BASES to use working endpoints:
  - `https://site.api.espn.com/apis/site/v2/sports` (primary)
  - `https://site.web.api.espn.com/apis/site/v2/sports` (fallback)
  - `https://sportscenter.api.espn.com/apis/site/v2/sports` (third option)
- Removed non-working `sports.core.api.espn.com` endpoint

## Manual Steps Required

### Critical: Expo SDK 53 Package Updates
You need to run these commands manually (I cannot modify package.json directly):

```bash
# Clean everything
rm -rf node_modules .expo .expo-shared bun.lock

# Update to SDK 53 compatible versions
npx expo install expo@~53.0.23 expo-blur@~14.1.5 expo-constants@~17.1.7 expo-font@~13.3.2 expo-image@~2.4.1 expo-linear-gradient@~14.1.5 expo-linking@~7.1.7 expo-location@~18.1.6 expo-router@~5.1.7 expo-splash-screen@~0.30.10 expo-symbols@~0.4.5 expo-system-ui@~5.0.11 expo-web-browser@~14.2.0 react-native@0.79.5 react-native-safe-area-context@5.4.0 react-native-screens@~4.11.1

# Reinstall dependencies
npm install
# or
bun install

# Clear Expo cache and restart
npx expo start -c
```

### Verify Environment Configuration
Ensure `.env` file exists with:
```env
ODDSAPI_KEY=a03349ac7178eb60a825d19bd27014ce
ENABLE_ODDSAPI=true
```

## Why ESPN API May Still Fail

Even with these improvements, ESPN APIs can fail due to:

1. **Rate Limiting**: ESPN may throttle requests from certain IPs
2. **CORS Restrictions**: ESPN actively blocks many proxy patterns
3. **Geographic Restrictions**: Some endpoints only work in certain regions
4. **Time-based Availability**: Endpoints may return 404 when no games are scheduled
5. **Authentication**: Some endpoints require ESPN+ subscription or cookies

## Current Behavior

### With Working ESPN API:
- âœ… Fetches real game data from ESPN
- âœ… Shows actual sportsbook lines when available
- âœ… Calculates MTO using real team statistics
- âœ… Displays team logos and venue information

### When ESPN API Fails:
- âœ… Automatically falls back to mock data
- âœ… Shows demonstration games so UI still functions
- âœ… Logs clear error messages for debugging
- âœ… Implements 60-second cooldown before retry

## Testing After Updates

1. **Run expo-doctor:**
   ```bash
   npx expo-doctor
   ```

2. **Check Console for:**
   - `[Proxy] Success - returned X events` (good)
   - `[Proxy] Cache HIT` (caching working)
   - `âœ“ Success with base: <url>` (ESPN API working)

3. **If ESPN Still Fails:**
   - Check browser DevTools Network tab
   - Look for actual error responses from ESPN
   - Verify `/api/fetch` proxy is being called
   - Check if mock data displays correctly

## Asset Configuration

Your `app.json` is already correctly configured:
- âœ… All asset paths point to existing files in `./assets/images/`
- âœ… No changes needed to asset configuration
- âœ… `.gitignore` properly excludes `.env` files

## Next Steps

1. Run the package update commands above
2. Restart the development server with cache clear
3. Check if ESPN data loads (look for console logs)
4. If ESPN still fails, the app will work with mock data
5. Consider using OddsAPI as primary source (already configured)

## Alternative: Use OddsAPI Instead

The app already has OddsAPI integration configured. If ESPN continues to fail, consider:
- Using OddsAPI for game schedules (they provide upcoming games)
- Fetching odds/totals from OddsAPI (working)
- Using mock data for team stats (already implemented)

## Files Modified
- âœ… `app/api/fetch+api.ts` - Enhanced proxy with caching
- âœ… `utils/realDataService.ts` - Updated ESPN base URLs

- ðŸ“„ `FIXES_APPLIED.md` - This summary

## Known Issues
- Lint warnings about `Array<T>` vs `T[]` syntax (cosmetic only)
- ESPN API may still fail due to external factors beyond our control
- Package updates must be done manually (blocked by tool restrictions)
